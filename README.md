In this code i have tried to make a algorithm to solve systems of ecuations using the LU method, manually, the final version asks the costumer what numbers he has
the first version has the matrix already set up. I understand there might be some problems if the costumers enters a matrix with 0 on it in some places. Im not using
pivot on this method. Even tought there were faster ideas to solve this, i find this to be more enjoyable and code it all by hand using basic operations to solve the 
sistems. This only uses console, glad to see you checking my repository. Will continue to work on projects. Take care. 30/March/2025
