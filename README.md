This script solves systems of linear equations using LU decomposition without pivoting, coded manually using basic operations.
The final version allows the user to input their own matrix and result vector through the console. The initial version used a predefined matrix.

⚠️ Please note: since this implementation does not use pivoting, it may fail or behave unexpectedly if the input matrix has zeros in certain positions.

I chose to implement this manually rather than using built-in LU solvers, as I find it more enjoyable and educational to understand the process step by step.

This tool is fully console-based. Thanks for checking out my repository — I’ll keep working on more projects.
Take care.
